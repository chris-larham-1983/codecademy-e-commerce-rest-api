## General Information

This is my solution to the **Codecademy** portfolio project entitled *e-commerce application REST API*, wherein I had to design 
a fully-functioning e-commerce application REST API that allows users to perform various *CRUD* operations such as registering for 
an account, browsing products etc.

The API had to satisfy the following requirements:

- be built using Express, Node.js, and Postgres
- allow users to register and log in via the API
- allow CRUD operations on products
- allow CRUD operations on user accounts
- allow CRUD operations on user carts
- allow a user to place an order
- allow CRUD operations on orders
- use Git version control
- be developed locally 
- be documented using Swagger
- be deployed live to Heroku using the command line

***

## Project Structure

I created 23 endpoints in order to fulfil the logical requirements of this project. These endpoints are thoroughly documented 
at the URL defined in the *Using the API* section at the bottom of this README.md. The endpoints communicate with a Postgresql 
database composed of five tables: **customers**, **addresses**, **products**, **cart**, and **orders**.
